# GGLeagues Web Beta Feedback
A website for logging feedback for the GGLeagues Web Beta!

## How to log an issue:

To log an issue, you can go to the issues tab and click "New Issue".  Alternatively, you can [click this link](https://github.com/GGLeagues/ggleagues-web-feedback/issues/new)

## Issue Format

When logging an issue, please make sure you use the pre-filled templates, and complete them thoroughly.  We have two options:

### Bug Report

Report a bug or issue with the current website.  Before logging your bug, please:

* Make sure you have checked the pinned message in Discord that details the current state of the beta website.  This will ensure you aren't reporting a bug on a currently known issue (like a page being static, or a component/feature being listed as "coming soon" or something similar)

* Make sure you check the current list of bugs in the Issues tab.  If one exists, please go and add your comment and add any additional details you may have (your browser/hardware configuration, alternate reproduction steps, more screenshots) as another comment in the thread

### Enhancement Request

Make a request for a change or new feature.  Before logging your bug, please:

* Make sure you check the pinned message in Discord that details the current roadmap so that you aren't making a new ticket for a feature that's already being developed.

* Don't log requests for a feature that is currently marked by a "Coming Soon" block on the website.  They're already in development :)

* Make sure you check the current list of bugs in the Issues tab.  If one exists, please go and add your comment and add any additional context or information to the request.  You can also just add a thumbs up to the comment section to let us know it's greatly requested
